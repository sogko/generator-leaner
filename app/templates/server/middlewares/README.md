# ExpressJS Middleware

Recommended folder to organize your custom ExpressJS middlewares.


## Sample middleware
Included with the default stack project is a sample (but useful!) middleware to parse incoming request queries as JSON.

Take a look at source: [parse-query-json.js](./parse-query-json.js)

The middleware has been enabled by default in [```/server/app.js```](../app.js)
